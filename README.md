# What is this?
This repository includes some personal projects that I sometimes do in my spare time. They will be artistic pictures, animations or even tunes that are generated by a computer program and are often inspired by a mathematical or physical phenomena. 
# Why?
Because along the way I practice my visualization and programing skills and above all I enjoy it.
